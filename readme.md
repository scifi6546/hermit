# Hermit
Hermit is a home video server that *stays* at home. Unlike plex and emby it does not 'phone home'. Hermit is designed to keep 
your data where it belongs at home.
## Features
Right now hermit is *very* limited. It can play videos and that is about it. It does not have a pretty ui and that will be 
worked on more seriously once there is a solid core server. 

## Limitations
Hermit by default does not work over https. I highly recomend using a reverse proxy like nginx or varnish to add https.
Hermit has also not been audited so the security is probably not very good. Go at your own risk!

## License
Hermit is licensed under the gplv3
